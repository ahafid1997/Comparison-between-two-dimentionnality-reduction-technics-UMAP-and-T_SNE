# Comparison-between-two-dimentionnality-reduction-technics-UMAP-and-T_SNE
The first project is related to the course Distributed Optimization and Games for machine learning of my international Master 2 UBINET. In the first project for Distributed Optimization and Games I have compared two types of dimensionality reduction techniques to see how and why the second technique called UMAP is outperforming the first technique named T-SNE. Furthermore, I have tried to mitigate the advantages of the two techniques to really ensure one better visualisation of data in low dimension comparing to the original UMAP technique, I implemented the algorithm of UMAP and I have introduced some changes on this implementation based on the intuitions of T-SNE algorithm and finally I keep comparing the visualisation of my new implementation with the original UMAP to see if the novelties introduced had really an effect on the visualisation of data in low dimension.
